A sudden door opening can be dangerous for other road users and for passengers getting out onto the road, especially when the passengers are children, who are not always aware of the danger.  So it's always best to get children into or out of the car on the kerbside."

More and more vehicles are fitted with electric handbrakes, which could be described as \"finger brakes\"!"

Stopping makes no sense here, as she has no intention of crossing. I slow down and pass cautiously, in case she decides to turn off abruptly, which would be dangerous."

Here, the passenger has put on her seatbelt, but is not correctly seated, with her back pressed against the seat. In the event of sudden braking, the belt could cause serious injuries to her chest and abdomen. It could also be thrown forward, causing serious injury to the driver."

These sounds give the driver greater control during the maneuver, which must always be carried out with caution. They do not, however, prevent the use of mirrors and eye checks, which are essential to ensure that everything is running smoothly."

I need to make myself visible without hindering other road users, so I use low beams."

      "What is stopping distance? It's the distance required between the moment I see the obstacle and the moment the vehicle comes to a complete stop. It therefore includes the distance covered during the reaction time and the braking distance. These distances vary according to speed, vehicle and ground conditions (and the state of the driver).  To calculate the approximate stopping distance, simply multiply the ten-fold speed by the speed itself. At 110 km/h, (11x11) 121 m. On wet roads, the stopping distance is longer."

      "Where should I position my eyes when driving? Visual exploration is particularly important when driving: look wide, far and around the vehicle. To anticipate, I look as far as possible, towards the horizon.  This enables me to anticipate my trajectory, but also to easily detect the movements of other road users, thus limiting the risk of road accidents."
