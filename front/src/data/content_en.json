And it restarts automatically as soon as I disengage the clutch to engage first gear.\n\nIt saves up to 10% fuel and reduces noise pollution. If my vehicle is not equipped with this system, I turn off the engine if I'm stopped for more than 20 seconds, at a red light for example, to save money and protect the environment."

      "What are the requirements for using an electric vehicle?\r\nThe short range of the battery allows you to travel between 100 and 300 km. This distance is shorter than that of a combustion engine vehicle, which can cover many more kilometers on a full tank of fuel.\r\n\r\nI prefer to use an electric vehicle for short journeys in town. It reduces noise and air pollution."

Keeping things simple, this energy accumulates over time, until the vehicle comes to a halt.\r\n\r\nDuring braking, the brakes convert this energy into heat. But if I don't have time to brake, kinetic energy is transformed into deformation energy on the bodywork (in particular) during an impact."

His belt can't protect him properly."

      "Does a 10 km/h difference really matter?\r\nThe more moderate the speed, the less the engine consumes and the wider the field of vision.\r\n \r\nDriving at 120 km/h instead of 130 km/h reduces fuel consumption by around 1 liter per 100 km, and cuts pollution emissions. Slower speeds also reduce the risk of accidents and traffic jams."

The triangle is therefore not required.\n\nThis would be all the more dangerous as walking on the hard shoulder is a real hazard."
